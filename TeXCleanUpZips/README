TeXCleanUpZips is a script that cleans up the zips from the working package directory of LaTeX. It assumes only an installation of TeXLive.

WARNINGS:

None (Just make sure that no important zips are in that folder :).)

EXAMPLES:


Welcome to the LaTeX zip clean-up magician.
Cleaning up the packages...
[sudo] password for jdc: 
Abracadabra!
Done. It's cleaned up.

(Notice my use of magician, not Windows's "wizard". Magician > wizard.)
